# Neptune

###### This repository contains the process of creating this network and completing the tasks.

Neptune is a virtual lab exercise. It is a network that delivers web content to visitors only in a specific region. The administrator collects data on how the web server performs along with other variables. The tasks of this lab are to perform a security audit on the internal network and identify vulnerabilities and patch them. The other is to perform a penetration test on the network and attempt to gather as much information as possible and report the process taken.
